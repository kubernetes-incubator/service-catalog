## `service-catalog`

### Terminology

**Application**: code that will access a Service. While in Kubernetes the code
that is deployed is often called a "Service", to avoid confusion, this
document will refer to the code that accesses a service as an "application".

**Service**: running code that is made available for use by an application.
Traditionally, services are available via HTTP REST endpoints, but this is not
a requirement.

**Service Broker**: An endpoint that manages a set of services.

**Service Catalog**: An endpoint that manages 1) a set of registered Service
Brokers and 2) the list of services that are available for instantiation from
those Service Brokers.

**Service Instance**: Each request for a unique use of a Service will result in
the Service Catalog requesting a new Service Instance from the owning Service
Broker.

**Cluster operator**: the team of people responsible for operating a Kubernetes
cluster. This team may operate the cluster on behalf of other users, or may
operate the cluster to facilitate their own work. The cluster operator "team"
may be one person

**Application developer**: the team of people responsible for developing consumer
applications. This "team" may be one person. Additionally, it may overlap
(partially or completely) with the cluster operator team

**Resource type**: a logical Kubernetes concept. Examples include:

  - [Pod](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/)s
  - [Service](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/)s
  - [Secret](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/secrets/)s

**Resource**: a specific instantiation of an aforementioned resource type,
often represented as a YAML or JSON file that is submitted or retrieved via the
standard Kubernetes API (or via `kubectl`)

### Purpose and Scope

The exact purpose of the SIG will grow over time, and as such, please see
the various "version" folders under the [docs](./docs) directory for the
exact list of use-cases, features and design decisions that have been agreed to.

However, this SIG is (initially) focused on an implementation of the
Cloud Foundry Service Broker APIs. This would include the ability for Service
Brokers to register themselves with a Kubernetes environment the same way
they can with a Cloud Foundry environment. Additionally, we will be exploring
what can be done to help Service developers when they want to expose their
code via a Service Broker.

We are currently scoping our **v1** milestone [here](./docs/v1). Interested
