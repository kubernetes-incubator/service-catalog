shows how to do a single thing, typically given by a short sequence of steps.

## [Install a Broker](./install_broker.md)

How to add a broker to your catalog. This will make the services that broker
available to users on your cluster. Adding it as a Cluster Service Broker
(CSB) will make it available cluster-wide. Adding it as a Service Broker,
also called a Namespaced Service Broker (NSB) will make it available
only in a single namespace.

## [Sync a Broker](./sync_broker.md)

How to re-sync a broker that is already added to your catalog. When a broker's
catalog changes, it may need to be resynced with Service Catalog.
