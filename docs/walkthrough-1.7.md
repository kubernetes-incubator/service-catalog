# Service Catalog Demonstration Walkthrough

This document assumes that you've installed Service Catalog onto your cluster.
If you haven't, please see [install-1.7.md](./install-1.7.md).

__Note: This document is a work in progress. Instructions for the self-guided demo
will be similar to those in the [1.6 walkthrough](./walkthrough-1.6.md),
but note that the commands in that document will not work as-is.__
