# Service Catalog docs

Welcome to the documentation for Service Catalog. This page is an index for
the articles in here. We recommend you start by reading the 
[introduction](introduction.md), and then move on to the 
[installation instructions](./install.md).

Afterward, see the below list of topics:

## Topics for users:
- [Passing parameters to ServiceInstances and ServiceBindings](./parameters.md)

## Topics for developers:
- [Code conventions](./code-standards.md)
- [Developer guide](./devguide.md)
- [Design](./design.md)
- [Notes on authentication](./auth.md)

## Request for Comments

As Service Catalog is in beta, we are collecting use-cases and other 
fundamental documentation for our eventual [V1 GA release here](./v1).
